# NexaLink

## Implementation of SUI
We created a move smart contract to create our own custom fungible token called NXC where there is a trusted manager that has admin privileges. The trusted manager has the ability to mint NXC coins, Burn NXC coins and transfer NXC coins to recipient address. We are using SUI client CLI to interact with the contract using the TreasuryCap  and Package ID of the published package.

NXC is our custom fungible token that the smart contract manages. It adheres to the blockchain standards for fungible tokens, making it compatible with various blockchain ecosystems. Players within our application can earn NXC tokens as rewards for their in-game achievements.
